# Project Title: Vaccine Recording System

# Project Description and Purpose:

In this Project we used Java Spring to create an Application Programming Interface (API), called the Vaccine Recording System.

It is the background system of an online Vaccine Recording System platform.

It consists of functionalities such as:

1. Creation of insured
2. View insured status
3. Creating and modifying appointments
4. Vaccine declaration

All functionalities were implemented by using HTTP calls returning information in JSON format.

# Operating Environment
Vaccine Recording System API was created using:

Java 11
Postman and Swagger UI, as third party tools, in order to perform the calls

# Running the application locally
In order to run this Spring Boot application on your local machine, you can execute the main method in the com.example.Vaccination_System.VaccinationSystemApplication  class from your IDE.
